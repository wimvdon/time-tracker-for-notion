# Usage guide

This guide assumes the app is installed ([installation.md](installation.md)). Steps are the same on Windows and Android unless noted. On Android, **Settings** is the gear icon at the top-right of the timer screen.

## 1. Prepare Notion

### 1.1 The Time Entries database

The app needs a database with at least:

| Column | Type | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| **Name** | Title | What you worked on (empty description → today's date) |
| **Time** | Date | Start and end |
| **Status** | Status | One option for running (e.g. *In progress*), one for finished (e.g. *Done*) |

To create one:
1. Make a new page.
2. Type `/database` › **Database - Inline**.
3. Add a **Date** column `Time` and a **Status** column `Status`. A Status column comes with *Not started*, *In progress* and *Done*.

**Optional: link entries to projects.** Add a **Relation** column pointing at your projects or clients database. The app detects it, keeps the link while you edit a running timer, and copies it when you restart an old entry. It never removes a link set in Notion.

### 1.2 Create a connection and give it access

Only a **Workspace Owner** can create a connection.

1. Go to [app.notion.com/developers](https://app.notion.com/developers) › **Internal connections** › **Create a new connection**.
2. Name it (e.g. `Time Tracker`) and pick the workspace.
3. On **Configuration**, enable **Read content**, **Update content** and **Insert content**.
4. Copy the **Installation access token** (starts with `ntn_` or `secret_`). Treat it like a password.
5. Open the page that contains your database › **•••** › **Connections** › **Add connection** › `Time Tracker` › **Confirm**.

Everything inside that page is included. If you'll use settings sync, the page where the sync page lives must be connected too.

## 2. Connect the app

### 2.1 Add the key

**Settings** › paste into **Notion API Key** › **Test connection & save**. Expect **API key works and was saved.**

### 2.2 Add a workspace

A *workspace* is one Time Entries database plus how you use it. Add several to track in several databases (e.g. work and a side project).

1. **Settings** › **Workspaces** › **+ Add workspace**.
2. Fill in:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Shown on the timer and presets, e.g. `Work` |
| **Time Entries database** | Your database. If the list is empty, click **Refresh**; if still empty, the connection lacks access (step 1.2.5). |
| **Date range field** | `Time` |
| **Status field** | `Status` |
| **Running status option** | *In progress* |
| **Completed status option** | *Done* |
| **Extra fields** *(optional)* | Up to five more columns shown on the timer (text, number, select, multi-select, status, date, checkbox, URL, email, phone, people, relation, file URL). Tick **Required** to block stopping until filled. |
| **Description required** | Block stopping until a description is entered |
| **Time rounding** | No rounding, 5, 10 or 15 minutes |
| **Workspace colour** | Colours the timer, preset chips and Windows tray icon |

3. **Save**, then go back to the timer with the **←** arrow.

## 3. Track time

### Start

1. Choose a **Workspace**.
2. Type what you are working on (the **Working on…** field on Windows, **Description** on Android). Leave it empty to title the entry with today's date.
3. Fill in extra fields.
4. Press **START**.

A Notion row appears with the running status. On Windows the tray stopwatch turns the workspace colour (red without one). On Android a notification shows the running timer.

### While running

| Action | Effect in Notion |
|---|---|
| Edit the description, press **Enter** or click away | Title updated immediately |
| Change an extra field | Saved shortly after you stop typing |
| Change **Start time** | Start corrected, e.g. if you forgot to press START |
| Fill **End time** | Stops the timer at that time |

On Android, **End time** and the extra fields sit under **Details** below the start time; tap it to open them. It opens by itself while a required field is still empty. The active and recent lists start below the timer: scroll down to reach them.

### Stop

Press **STOP**. Unsaved edits are flushed first. The row gets its end time and the *done* status. With rounding, start and end are rounded to the nearest step and the entry lasts at least one step.

Also possible:
- **Windows:** tray icon › right-click › **Stop timer**.
- **Android:** **Stop** in the notification, even with the app closed.

### Lists on the timer screen

- **Active timers:** entries running in Notion, e.g. started on your phone. Click one to continue it on this device.
- **Recent time entries:** the last finished entries. ▶ starts a new timer with the same details.
- **Refresh:** both lists reload automatically every minute, or on demand with the refresh button (bottom on Windows, top on Android).

If the timer is stopped on another device, this one clears it within a minute: **Timer was stopped on another device.**

## 4. Presets

A preset remembers a workspace, a title, a description and extra field values, and starts a timer in one click.

**Create:**
1. Set up the timer form the way you want it.
2. Click the bookmark button next to **START**.
3. Enter a title (required, it's the button label) › **Save**.

**Use:** click a preset chip at the top of the timer screen. If a timer is running, choose **Stop & start new** or **Cancel**. Chips appear once a key is set.

**Without opening the app:**
- **Windows:** right-click the tray icon (first 10 presets), or launch the app with `--preset=<id>` (see [api.md](api.md#4-windows-command-line-arguments)).
- **Android:** long-press the app icon (up to 4 presets).

**Manage:** click the pencil after the chips. Reorder with the arrows, delete with the bin, then **Dismiss**.

## 5. Same settings on every device

Settings sync copies these through a Notion page:
- workspaces, extra fields, presets, rounding and colours;
- appearance, language and date/time format.

It does **not** copy the API key or device-only options (**Keep window on top**, **Start with Windows**, Android dynamic colour).

**First device:**
1. **Settings** › **Sync** › **Create new**.
2. Enter a page title.
3. Pick a parent page that is connected to your key (**Create inside** on Windows, **Select a page…** on Android).
4. **Create**. Expect **Sync page created**.

**Other devices:**
1. Add the key.
2. **Sync** › **Load existing**.
3. Choose the page › **Attach**.

Changes reach other devices within about a minute. If the same settings changed on two devices, the most recent save wins as a whole.

## 6. Other settings

| Setting | Platform | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Theme | both | Auto, light or dark |
| Dynamic colour | Android 12+ | Material You colours from the wallpaper |
| Language | both | English, Dutch, French, German, Spanish, Italian, or system |
| Date / time format | both | `DD/MM/YYYY`, `MM/DD/YYYY`, `YYYY-MM-DD`; 24h or 12h |
| Keep window on top | Windows | Mini window stays above others |
| Start with Windows | Windows | Starts hidden in the tray at login |
| Show "Open in Notion" link / archive action | both | Extra actions on active and recent entries (archive moves the page to Notion's Trash) |

## 7. Troubleshooting

| What you see | Fix |
|---|---|
| **Connection failed** on test | Re-copy the token without spaces around it |
| **No databases found** | The connection has no access to the page (step 1.2.5), then **Refresh** |
| **Fill in required fields before stopping.** | Fill the red fields, press **STOP** again |
| **Page not found in Notion** | The entry was deleted. **Dismiss**, or restore it from Notion's **Trash** |
| Window closed but app won't reopen (Windows) | It's in the tray: **^** next to the clock › right-click › **Open** |
| **Windows protected your PC** | **More info** › **Run anyway** (unsigned installer) |
| **App not installed** (Android) | Allow installs from the Files app; uninstall a self-built copy first |
| No notification (Android) | Settings › Apps › Time Tracker › Notifications › on |
| No preset shortcuts (Android) | Create a preset and open the app once, then long-press the icon |
