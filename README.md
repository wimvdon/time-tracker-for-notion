## Description

Press **Start** when you begin working and **Stop** when you're done. Time Tracker writes each block of time as a row in your own Notion database, from a small always-on-top window on Windows or from an Android app.

- **What it does:**
  - Creates a Notion page with status *In progress* when a timer starts.
  - Fills in the end time and sets *Done* when it stops.
  - Optional time rounding, extra database fields, presets and one-click restarts of recent entries.
- **What problem it solves:** Notion has no built-in timer. Tracking time there means typing dates by hand or wiring up buttons and formulas. This app keeps the data in Notion, where you already report on it, and makes recording it a single click.
- **Real use case:** a freelancer tracks client work in a *Time Entries* database related to a *Projects* database. They start timers from the Windows tray during the day and from the phone notification on the go. Both devices share workspaces and presets through a Notion sync page.

## Quick start

1. Download the installer (`.exe`) and/or the Android APK from the [latest release](https://github.com/impca201/time-tracker-for-notion/releases/latest).
2. Create a Notion connection, copy its token, and connect it to the page that holds your Time Entries database.
3. In the app: **Settings** › paste the key › **Test connection & save** › **+ Add workspace**, then press **Start**.

Full walkthrough: [docs/usage.md](docs/usage.md).

To run the desktop app from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/impca201/time-tracker-for-notion.git
cd time-tracker-for-notion/windows
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Technologies used

| Area | Windows app (`windows/`) | Android app (`android/`) |
|---|---|---|
| Language | JavaScript (ES modules, CommonJS in Electron main) | Kotlin 2.4 |
| UI | React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, Fluent UI icons | Jetpack Compose, Material 3 |
| State | Zustand | ViewModel + `StateFlow` |
| Shell / runtime | Electron 42 (tray, Mica, single instance) | Foreground service for the running timer |
| Storage | electron-store (API key encrypted with Windows DPAPI) | DataStore + EncryptedSharedPreferences |
| HTTP | Node `fetch` in the main process | OkHttp + kotlinx.serialization |
| Build | Vite 6, electron-builder (NSIS), Node.js 24 (`windows/.nvmrc`) | Gradle 9.8, AGP 9.4, R8 |
| Tests | `node:test`, ESLint, installer smoke test on Windows | JUnit 4 unit tests, Android lint |

Shared:
- **External service:** Notion REST API (`2022-06-28`).
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions checks every pull request (with a Dev installer and a debug APK to try), builds both apps and publishes one release; Dependabot keeps dependencies current.
- **Rules for Claude Code sessions:** [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md). **Privacy:** [`PRIVACY.md`](PRIVACY.md).

## Quick installation

- **Use it:** download from [Releases](https://github.com/impca201/time-tracker-for-notion/releases) and install.
- **Develop on Windows:** Node.js 24 (`windows/.nvmrc`), then `cd windows && npm ci && npm run dev`.
- **Develop on Android:** open `android/` in Android Studio and run.

Details: [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md).

## Architecture (summary)

Two independent clients talk directly to the Notion API with the user's own integration token; there is no backend. Notion is both the data store for time entries and the shared state between devices:
- **Running timers:** a page whose status is the "running" option.
- **Settings:** a JSON code block on a "sync page", merged by "newest `updatedAt` wins".

On Windows the API key and all HTTP calls stay in the Electron main process; the React renderer reaches them only through a narrow preload bridge. Details: [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).
